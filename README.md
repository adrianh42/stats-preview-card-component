## My process

I wrote down the semantics of the html first, then classes and all that.
Next I did the CSS styling with SCSS, using a simple anb short CSS-reset I found on css-tricks.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Responsive design to change the flow of content just by using flexbox while having zero to minimal changes to the media query.

### Continued development

I tried using CSS Grids for the stats but couldn't figure out how to control the width of the items the way I wanted to. Ended up using flexbox instead.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Cool website and has a good almanac of CSS, it has better examples than W3 or MDN in my opinion.
